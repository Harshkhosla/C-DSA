// Binary Search:

// Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search space in half until the target element is found.
// Binary search is useful when you have a sorted array and need to search for a specific element efficiently.
// If the data is not sorted, you'll need to sort it first using an appropriate sorting algorithm (like selection sort, quicksort, or mergesort) before applying binary search.
// Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which makes it very efficient for large arrays. It's particularly useful when the dataset is large and searching needs to be performed frequently.
