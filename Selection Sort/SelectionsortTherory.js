// Selection Sort:

// Selection sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works well for small arrays or when the auxiliary space is limited.
// If you have a small array that needs to be sorted, selection sort can be a reasonable choice as it has a simple implementation and doesn't require any additional data structures.
// However, selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), so it's not efficient for large arrays. If you're dealing with large datasets, it's better to consider more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort.
